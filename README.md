## Features

- 🛠️ **Easy to Use** – Simple interface for adding and removing balls
- 🎨 **Customizable** – Change colors, sizes, and more
- 🔄 **Dynamic** – Balls bounce around the screen
- 🫸 **Collision** – Balls bounce off each other and the walls

## Recommended properties values

- **speed**: 0 - 8 (after 15 physics can get weird)
- **Color**: Any color you like (HEX format)
- **acceleration**: 0 - 1000
- **restitution**: 0 - 1 (0 = no bounce, 1 = perfect bounce)
- **number of balls**: 1 - 20 (more can get out of the screen)

**Consider that a positive Y acceleration will make the balls fall down, while a negative Y acceleration will make them go up.**
